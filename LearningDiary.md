LEARNING DIARY — FULL-STACK MODULE

Date: 25.10.2025
Activity: NodeJS
Learning outcome:
I set up a Node.js environment and created a minimal server. I learned npm basics and how backend JS differs from browser JS.

Date: 26.10.2025
Activity: MongoDB
Learning outcome:
I created a MongoDB Atlas cluster and connected it from Node.js using Mongoose. I practiced simple CRUD on a collection.

Date: 27.10.2025
Activity: ExpressJS
Learning outcome:
I built REST endpoints with Express and structured routes and controllers for clean separation.

Date: 28.10.2025
Activity: React
Learning outcome:
I created a Vite-based React app, worked with components and fetched data from an API.

Date: 29.10.2025
Activity: MERN Integration
Learning outcome:
I connected the React frontend with the Express backend and handled CORS, environment variables and concurrent dev servers.

Activity: MERN Workout Tracker Project  
Learning outcome: I built a full-stack workout tracking application using the MERN stack. I set up a MongoDB Atlas cloud database and connected it securely through environment variables. I created a Mongoose model to structure workout data and implemented API routes in Express to handle creating, listing, and deleting workouts. On the frontend, I connected a Vite-based React app to the backend using fetch requests and updated the UI dynamically based on API responses.  
During development, I debugged routing and file-path issues, particularly when the routes folder was mistakenly placed inside the models folder. Fixing this improved my understanding of backend folder structure and import path resolution. I also learned how CORS works and how the browser communicates with a local API server during development. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in connecting backend and frontend systems, working with databases, and troubleshooting real full-stack issues.
